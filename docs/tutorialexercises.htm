<p class="bodytext"><strong>It is suggested that you keep open a copy of the <a href="Users_guide.pdf" onclick="window.open('drydepo.htm','qqq','resizable,scrollbars,toolbar')" target="qqq">WRF-Chem User's Guide</a> when doing the following exercises.  </strong></p>
<p></p>
<p> These tutorial exercises focus on the set-up and running of the WRF-Chem model. Each exercise will provide the user with previously constructed emissions data files so that the student can focus on learning the methodology instead of data gathering and processing.

<h3>Exercise 1: Building an initial field that contains dust erosion map and running WRF-Chem. </h3>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Purpose</strong>: To familiarize the user with the WRF WPS and the
             methodology for preparing the initial fields for a simulation that
             includes a dust emissions in a WRF-Chem simulation.  The domain 
             is located over the Mediterrainian region.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="tutorialexercises/tutorialexercises001.html">Go to exercise 1</a> </p>
<br/>
<h3>Exercise 2: Using the the prep_chem tool to conduct volcanic ash simulation. </h3>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Purpose</strong>: To familiarize the user with the available global volcanic data set. This data set uses a program called "prep_chem_sources" to read the grid location and volcano information and map the eruption data to the user specified simulation domain. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="tutorialexercises/tutorialexercises002.html">Go to exercise 2</a> </p>
<br/>
<h3>Exercise 3: US Emission </h3>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Purpose</strong>: In this exercise you can generate anthropogenic emissions for WRF-Chem domain over CONUS in 60km resolution. </p>
<p class="bodytext"><a href="tutorialexercises/tutorialexercises003.html">Go to exercise 3</a> </p>
<br/>
<h3>Exercise 4:  Using the Global emissions data (anthropogenic, sea salt, biomass burning) emissions for your domain (RACM-KPP-GOCART option). </h3>
<p class="bodytext"><strong>Purpose</strong>: To familiarize the user with the available global emissions data set. This data set uses a program called "prep_chem_sources" to read the emissions data and map it to the user specified simulation domain. The program is capable of mapping anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, sea salt as well as biomass burning (wildfire) and volcanic ash emissions to the user domain.  </p>

<h3>Exercise 2: WRF-Chem simulation using GOCART aerosols.</h3>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>Purpose</strong>: Using the Global emissions data (dust, sea salt, biomass burning)
             for a domain over the Mediterrainian region.
             This exercise should be attempted after the user is 
             familiar with the WRF WPS and dust erosion map production outlined in exercise_1.
</p>

</p> This exercise is intended to be completed by students 
           that have knowledge about setting-up and running the
           WRF numerical model.  This application of the WRF-Chem model should be attempted 
           only by those user familiar with the set-up and 
           running of the WPS as well as the WRF model.

<h3>Exercise 3: WRF-Chem simulation including biogenic emissions.
</h3>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>Purpose</strong>: To familiarize the user with the methodology
           by which the MEGAN biogenic emissions are introduced into the WRF-Chem simulation.

</p> This exercise is intended to be completed by students 
           that have knowledge about setting-up and running the
           WRF numerical model.  This application of the WRF-Chem model should be attempted 
           only by those user familiar with the set-up and 
           running of the WPS as well as the WRF model.

<h3>Exercise 4: Running WRF-Chem with aerosol direct and indirect forcing.
</h3>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>Purpose</strong>: To familiarize the user with the use of the WRF-Chem model
          and all of the possible namelist settings.  One of the most
          popular research settings when running the WRF-Chem model is
          to examine the impact of the direct and indirect effect upon
          the simulation results.  However, this is not a trivial
          feature set to switch on.  Not every chemistry option has 
          the feedback capability at this time.
</p>
<p>
          The user will need to be very familiar with the WRF-Chem 
          namelist options provided in the User's guide as well as the
          quick_start and WRF-Chem FAQ web site.  There are several 
          namelist options that need to be set so that both direct 
          and indirect effects are functioning.  The simulation will 
          run if an incorrect option is selected so the user needs 
          to know exactly what is being used.

<h3>Exercise 5: Cycling the chemistry when making a WRF-Chem forecast.
</h3>

<p class="bodytext"><strong>Purpose</strong>: To familiarize the user with the use of the WRF-Chem model
          and the process of cycling the chemistry fields in a new forecast.  This process is 
	  most useful when making daily forecasts and little to no chemical observations are available
          to initialize the chemical state of the atmosphere.
