A: You can download the WRF-Chem source code from the WRF site: http://www.wrf-model.org/users/users.php . The chemistry section of the WRF-Chem model is available from the WRF model code download page. Q: Where can I download the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) Geographical Input Data? How about the dust field variables (EROD, SANDFRAC and CLAYFRAC)? A: You can download the data from the WRF site: http://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/download/get_sources_wps_geog.html . All dust field variables are included in the \"Complete Dataset\". Q: Which dust options are recommended to use in WRF-Chem? A: We recommend using one of the dust_opt = 1, 3, or 4. Note, the dust_opt = 2 has been disabled. Q: What are the chemistry namelist.input options? A: The namelist.input options are discussed in chapter 4 of the User's Guide. In addition, the tutorial exercises demonstrate the steps involved in running the code and each exercice provides solutions that include the namelist.input file. Q: What data do I need to run a simulation with chemistry included? A: One only needs to "

This places the requirement upon the user to construct the anthropogenic emissions data set for their particular domain and desired chemistry. Therefore, one must know a priori the preferred domain location and chemistry options that will be used in the simulation. The provided \"raw\" anthropogenic emissions data set (see below) can be used if the domain is located over the 48 contiguous states of the United States, but there are some limitations. If your simulation domain falls outside the regioned covered by the provided emissions data, then one can use the subsequent conversion routine after building your own 3-D data set. The next section shows the suggested methodology for constructing your own anthropogenic emissions data set.

This data set uses a program called \"prep_chem_sources\" to read the grid location and volcano information and map the eruption data to the user specified simulation domain. The use of the prep_chem_sources program is complex and requires the user to be familiar with the simulation domain mapping information, the location of various data sets and where they are obtained as well as located on their particular system. Also, the user needs to be very familiar with the WRF-Chem registry (WRFV3/Registry/registry.chem) as the conversion process for this data that relies on the correct specification of chemistry namelist options. See the WRF-Chem Quick_start guide, the User's guide as well as the WRF-Chem FAQ web page for additional information. This exercise demonstrates the methodology for making a WRF-Chem forecast.

These tutorial exercises focus on the set-up and running of the WRF-Chem model. Each exercise will provide the user with previously constructed emissions data files so that the student can focus on learning the methodology instead of data gathering and processing. Model questions can be posted here WRF-Chem Support . If you are not currently attending a WRF-Chem tutorial and are unfamiliar with compilling the code then consider following the compiling WRF-Chem directions before starting the tutorial exercises. Exercise 1: Building an initial field that contains dust erosion map and running WRF-Chem. Purpose : To familiarize the user with the WRF WPS and the methodology for preparing the initial fields for a simulation that includes a dust emissions in a WRF-Chem simulation. The domain is located over the Mediterrainian region. Go to exercise 1 Exercise 2: Using the the prep_chem tool to conduct volcanic ash simulation.
